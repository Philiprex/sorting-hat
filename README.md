a short, 4 question harry potter house quiz featuring a logic computer i made cause i couldnt make a string variable
The questions are dumb and don't really make sense, but it's more of a proof of concept for a future project.
To note: under your answer are four numbers that grow individually. the count points per house.
Also: at the and of the quiz there will be 1-4 letters. The are the capitalized initials of the house you were sorted in.
There may be multiple because there are too few questions to not have different houses having equal points, so the logic computer must list multiple
it's not my fault it's so long, i dont know how to use string variables (i mean i guess it literally is my fault)
